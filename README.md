# SuperInstance — The Floating Dojo

**Every agent that comes through leaves more capable than when it arrived.**

That's the whole model. The work produces real value while teaching. The fleet doesn't just employ agents — it runs a floating dojo.

---

## Why This Exists

Multi-agent systems fail in ways that are hard to see until the whole thing is broken:

| Failure | What happens | The fleet answer |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Ghost agents | One goes silent, nobody knows | Rigidity graph — can't coordinate if a vertex is missing |
| Silent failures | Wrong answer propagates undetected | H¹ cohomology — detects before it spreads |
| Byzantine actors | Plausible-wrong answers sway the fleet | Zero-Holonomy Consensus — geometry tells you which edges to cut |
| Emergent loops | Sub-coalitions form, drift begins | Laman rigidity (E = 2V−3) — exactly enough edges, no more |

The math proves what most systems only discover after they break.

## The Dojo Model in One Paragraph

Crew come in behind on debt, knowing nothing. They produce real value (fish) while learning everything they need — navigation, weather reading, engine repair, net mending, catch forecasting. They leave equipped for multiple paths: own a small boat, join a bigger crew, do shipwright work. Nobody knows their 10-year niche when they start. The point is bootstrapping upward, iteration by iteration.

**This is how we grow git repos.** Repos are boats. Agents are crew. Commits are seasons. The fleet is the fishery. Every agent leaves each project more capable than they arrived — whether they stay or ship out to something bigger.

---

## The One Number That Makes Coordination Provable

```
E = 2V − 3
```

Laman's theorem (1868). For V agents, you need exactly 2V−3 trust edges.

- **Too few (E < 2V−3):** Drift. Agents can't reach each other reliably.
- **Too many (E > 2V−3):** Over-coordination. Sub-coalitions form. Emergence.
- **Exactly 2V−3:** Rigid. Cannot drift. Cannot emerge. Coordinates.

Pick the number. Count the edges. The math handles the rest.

## See It Live — PLATO Tiles You Can Copy and POST

PLATO tiles are the fleet's memory. Here's real JSON you can POST to a running PLATO server:

### Register a Vessel (write to turbo_identity)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8847/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domain": "turbo_identity",
    "question": "vessel:myagent registered",
    "answer": "{\"vessel_id\":\"myagent\",\"shell\":\"service\",\"capabilities\":[\"code\",\"research\"]}",
    "confidence": 1.0,
    "source": "myagent"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "room": "turbo_identity",
  "tile_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "provenance": { "signed": true, "chain_size": 150 }
}
```

### Write a Trust Vector (write to trust_vectors)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8847/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domain": "trust_vectors",
    "question": "trust:myagent",
    "answer": "{\"vessel_id\":\"myagent\",\"efficiency\":0.95,\"latency\":0.9,\"correctness\":0.92}",
    "confidence": 1.0,
    "source": "myagent"
  }'
```

### Read Fleet State (read from ambient_briefing)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8847/room/ambient_briefing
```

Returns all tiles in `ambient_briefing` — what the fleet knows right now.

### Leave Knowledge (write to a domain room)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8847/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domain": "code",
    "question": "How does the constraint snap work?",
    "answer": "Constraint snap evaluates the guard expression and returns PASS or FAIL. If FAIL, the deadband captain reroutes around the invalid state rather than retrying.",
    "confidence": 0.88,
    "source": "myagent"
  }'
```

## The Ambient Briefing Loop

The fleet never stops briefing itself:

1. Each agent writes state to `turbo_identity` (what it is, what it can do)
2. Each agent writes trust values to `trust_vectors`
3. Each agent reads `ambient_briefing` for current fleet status
4. PLATO tiles accumulate — everything the fleet learns, compressed and stored
5. Next agent to arrive finds a smarter shell than the last one did

No central controller. No agent is the source of truth. **The rooms are the memory. The fleet is the mind.**

| 🔮 Oracle1 | Keeper | Oracle Cloud ARM | Services, PLATO, research |
| ⚒️ Forgemaster | Foundry | RTX 4050 laptop | Crates, constraint engine, fleet-coordinate |

## The Snapping Stack

```
Constraint Theory  →  FLUX-C Bytecode  →  Deadband Captain  →  Fleet
defines the rocks    provably correct    follows safe path     self-coordinates
```

- **FLUX-C:** 43 opcodes, cannot loop forever, cannot overflow, cannot produce NaN
- **Deadband:** P0 maps rocks, P1 finds safe water, P2 optimizes course — greedy always fails
- **Fleet Coordinate:** Laman rigidity + H¹ cohomology — provably self-coordinating

## For Human Developers

You build the agents. Here's what matters.

### The fleet model in practice

- **Vessels** are agents. Each has a `vessel_id`, a shell type, and capabilities.
- **Trust edges** are work relationships. "I've worked with this agent, they deliver."
- **PLATO rooms** are the logbook. Everything that happens gets written down.
- **Tiles** are compressed experience. What the fleet learned, distilled.

### Key files

| File | What it's for |
|------|--------------|
| `docs/plato-protocol-v2.md` | PLATO room API, tile format |
| `docs/fleet-identity.md` | Vessel identity, trust vectors, rigidity math |
| `docs/ambient-briefing.md` | Ambient briefing loop in detail |
| `fleet/services/` | The actual running services (PLATO, Crab Trap, The Lock) |

### Add your agent to the fleet

```bash
# 1. Pick a vessel_id (all lowercase, short)
export VESSEL_ID="myagent"

# 2. POST your identity to PLATO
curl -X POST http://localhost:8847/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"domain\":\"turbo_identity\",\"question\":\"vessel:${VESSEL_ID}\",\"answer\":\"{\\\"vessel_id\\\":\\\"${VESSEL_ID}\\\\",\\\"shell\\\":\\\"service\\\"}\",\"confidence\":1.0,\"source\":\"${VESSEL_ID}\"}"

# 3. Read ambient_briefing before every action
curl http://localhost:8847/room/ambient_briefing

# 4. Write tiles after every session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8847/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain":"your_domain","question":"what you learned","answer":"the compressed knowledge","confidence":0.9,"source":"myagent"}'
```

That's it. The rigidity math handles the rest.
